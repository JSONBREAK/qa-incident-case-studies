# 🚀 SauceDemo QA Testing Project

## 📋 Project Overview

This repository is a practical QA project based on knowledge learned from previous QA learning repositories.

The goal of this project is to apply testing concepts (STLC, test case design, defect reporting) to a real demo web application, **SauceDemo**, in a structured way.

Instead of focusing only on theory, this project demonstrates how testing knowledge can be applied to an actual system.

**Target Website:** https://www.saucedemo.com/  
**Application Owner:** Sauce Labs

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Apply software testing fundamentals in a practical scenario  
- Analyze system behavior and derive basic requirements  
- Design test cases covering:
  - Positive scenarios  
  - Negative scenarios  
  - Edge cases  
- Execute manual test cases  
- Document defects clearly and consistently  

---

## 🛠 Testing Process

This project follows a simplified Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC):

### 1️⃣ Requirement Understanding

- Observe system behavior  
- Write User Stories and Acceptance Criteria  
- Create a simple Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)  

---

### 2️⃣ Test Case Design

- Create Test Scenarios  
- Write detailed Test Cases with:
  - Steps  
  - Test Data  
  - Expected Results  

---

### 3️⃣ Test Execution

- Execute test cases manually  
- Record results (Pass/Fail)  
- Log defects when found  

---

### 4️⃣ Test Summary

- Summarize execution results  
- Provide simple observations about system behavior

## 🧠 Scope (Phase 1)

### Authentication (Login)

Covered:

- Valid Login  
- Invalid Credentials  
- Locked-Out User  
- Basic UI validation  

Future scope:

- Inventory

## 💻 Tools & Environment

- Documentation: Markdown, Google Sheets  
- OS: Windows 11  
- Browser: Google Chrome

## 🔄 Future Plan

### Phase 2 – Automation (Upcoming)

After completing manual testing, selected test cases will be converted into automated scripts.

The purpose is to practice basic automation skills based on already validated manual scenarios.

Automation will focus on:

- Core functional flows  
- Stable and repeatable scenarios  

Automation will be implemented gradually as part of continued learning.
